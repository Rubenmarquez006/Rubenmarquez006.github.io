### CPSC 120

* Lab 4, part 1

    Lab 4, part 1 was one of my favorites because part 1 was the first lab that allowed us to create a type of game. For this lab, my partner and I made a two-player guessing game. Player one would type a number on the computer, and player two would try to guess the number. I have always enjoyed playing guessing games; being able to create one was fun. In this lab, I learned how to make and use if-statements for the first time, which would be essential for the remainder of the course. I also learned how to use boolean operations to test the if-statement conditions, in this case, to check if the number guessed was the right one. Once I understood how to make if-statements and their conditions, the rest of the lab was easy to follow.

* Lab 7, part 1

    Lab 7, part 1 was one of my favorites because it showed me how computer science can be used in real-world situations. In this case, we made a program that enforced parking restrictions rules on signs. Sometimes, when I would see those types of signs, I would ask myself if those rules are enforced; being able to create a code that enforces these rules showed me that they are enforced. In this lab, I learned how to use boolean data to check for strings and integers. I also learned how to use std::stoi to convert string variables into integer variables. Understanding how to have boolean functions check variables and knowing when to use std::stoi facilitated future labs.

* Lab 8, part 2

    Lab 8 part 2 was one of my favorite labs of the semester because part 2 demonstrated a more creative side to coding. We were required to make a pattern with bars, dashes, and asterisks using loops. Similar to how some people create designs using these same keys(bars, dashes, asterisks, etc). This lab was the first time I used loops. In part 2, I learned that through the use of for-loops, I could create images and designs. We didn't quite make an image or design, but with what I learned, I could use it to create a design/image in the future.
